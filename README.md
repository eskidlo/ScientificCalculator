# Scientific Calculator

## Overview 
This repository contains two versions of a scientific calculator: 

- **C version**: Implemented in C using QT graphics library. The graphical interface is written in C++, and due to my limited experience with C++ at the time of development, the code may seem less refined. 

- **C++ version**: Implemented in C++ using the Qt graphics library. This version benefits from a more polished implementation of both the core functionality and the interface, reflecting a better understanding of C++ features and practices.

Both versions offer the following features:
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Trigonometric Functions**: Support for cosine, sine, tangent, arccosine, arcsine, and arctangent.
- **Square Root Calculation**: Computes the square root of a number.
- **Logarithms**: Computes both natural and common logarithms.
- **Function Graphing**: Displays a graph of a function from  X.

## Installation 

To install either version of the calculator,ensure you are on the `develop` branch and navigate to the respective directory (for C or C++) and run the following command: 

```bash
make install
